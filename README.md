The site consists of the following parts and functionalities (from top to bottom):
1. **Navigation**

    * Therefore without control but will auto rotate
3. **About Me**
    * Self introduction
4. **My Work**
    * A carousel containing thumbnails linking to another carousel presented in lightbox format, presenting images in maximum size
    * "Pagination" is achieved by making use of the thumbnail carousel, where the tabs "COLOR" and "B&W" are actually the Prev and Next controls
        * This is done on purpose to avoid reloading the page
5. **Contact**
    * A dummy contact form without posting function
    * To be updated
6. **Keep in Touch**
    * A collection of social media links
    * To be updated
